## Usage Scenarios

Syncfusion’s dashboard adapts naturally to logistics and supply chain workflows, offering clarity for stakeholders and managers

### Shipment Tracking

- Use KPI cards to instantly monitor shipment status, delivery timelines, and turnaround performance.
- Analyze daily/hourly turnover trends to detect delays, short‑term variations, or bottlenecks in logistics.

### Inventory Management

- Visualize stock movement with ColumnSeries and WaterfallSeries to track increases, decreases, and net flow.
- Compare inventory vs. sales ratios to identify overstocking, missed demand, or slow-moving items.

### Operational Insights

- Spot inefficiencies by correlating KPIs with comparative charts (e.g., turnover vs. inventory value).
- Detect overstocking or missed demand using inventory-to-sales analysis and top-item ranking charts.

### Technologies Used

- **.NET MAUI:** Cross-platform UI framework
- **Syncfusion .NET MAUI Toolkit:** Advanced charting and gauge controls
- **C# & XAML:** Implementation languages
- **MVVM Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns with ViewModels and immutable model classes
